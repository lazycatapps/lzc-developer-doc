v1.2.0 Released on 2025-1-6

Feature Changes
=======

1. Added [Application Usage Instructions](../spec/manifest.md#basic-config) feature for stronger application usage prompts
2. Added [setup_script](../advanced-setupscript) feature for simple initialization operations
3. Added [user](../spec/manifest.md#container-config) field, compatible with docker-compose syntax
4. Added [TCP/UDP Dynamic Port Forwarding](../advanced-public-api#tcp-udp-ingress)
   ::: tip Note
   Previous versions' manifest.yml:application.ingress field only supported fixed port forwarding,
   new version supports dynamic forwarding with specified port ranges
   :::
5. Added [exclude public_path](../advanced-public-api) syntax
6. Removed replace `$$` to `$` conversion operation.
   ::: tip Note
   In previous versions, `$$` appearing in `lzc-manifest.yml` files would be forcibly replaced with `$`
   :::
7. Added `LAZYCAT_APP_DOMAIN` to deployment environment variables to avoid confusion
   ::: tip Note
   Previous versions only had `LAZYCAT_APP_ORIGIN` in deployment environment variables, but runtime automatically injected environment variables only had `LAZYCAT_APP_DOMAIN`.
   New version adds `LAZYCAT_APP_DOMAIN` in both runtime and deployment.

Bug Fixes
=======

1. Fixed issue where ssh password was lost after restart
2. Fixed system interference with `http Authorization header` (e.g., when applications use basic auth)
   ::: tip Note
   Previous versions' system would parse `http authorization header` as LCMD's own account password, causing applications to be unable to use this field
   :::
3. Added `hc data_convert` command after ssh, supports online conversion of raid0/raid1/plain
4. Fixed issue where pg-docker could not automatically start after power failure restart



Unimplemented Features
==============
1. Support [Dynamic Rendering of lzc-manifest.yml](../advanced-manifest-render.md) feature, allowing some parameters to be configured by users after application installation.
2. Experimental support for [Deployment Guide](../advanced-user-deploy-guide.md) feature, allowing some parameters to be configured by users after application installation.
