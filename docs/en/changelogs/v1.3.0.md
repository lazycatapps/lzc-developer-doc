v1.3.0 Released on 2025-2-17

# Feature Changes

- Ignore entries named "app" in `services.depends_on` in manifest.yml.
  Because the system will force wait for all containers to be ready, there is no need to fill this in. On the contrary, filling it in will cause circular waiting leading to timeout.
- services in manifest.yml support `init` field, so a small number of containers can enable child process recycling
- lpk supports embedding [compose.override.yml](../advanced-compose-override.md) files to support functions not yet covered by lpk
- When uploading logs, a copy of the actually uploaded log file will be stored in the administrator cloud drive root directory
- lzcos `vm.max_map_count` adjusted to 1048576
- Added resolvectl in ssh for convenient DNS status query
- Fixed issue where pg-docker cannot auto-start after restart
- Updated docker-ce to 27.5.1
- Added [Internationalization](../spec/manifest#i18n)/Localization support
- lzcapp forced network isolation enabled, prohibiting direct network communication between different applications. Cross-application communication is done through `$service.$appid.lzcapp` form. (Containers within applications are not subject to this restriction)
  - If cross-application access was previously configured, it needs to be migrated to port forwarding tools, forwarding target ports to "LCMD virtual network card" for indirect access.
  - Please update lzc-cli to 1.2.61+, otherwise it may not be able to enter devshell normally due to old version mechanism
