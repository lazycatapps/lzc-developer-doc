v1.3.3 Released on 2025-2-24

# Feature Changes

- Support configuring multiple [Secondary Domains](../advanced-secondary-domains) for one lzcapp
- Support globally disabling default mounting of user documents
- pkgm level forced detection of `min-os-version`
- Document snapshots enabled by default regardless of whether backup disk is used (once per hour, retain last 48 hours)
- lpk supports applications using grpc-web traffic (need to enable `ext_config.disable_grpc_web_on_root`)
- Home directory after ssh adjusted to permanent storage
- Fixed lpk file association



In v1.5.0, the ability for applications to access user document data will be disabled by default. If applications really need to access user documents,
they can configure the [application.ext_config.enable_document_access](../spec/manifest#ext_config) field in advance

If you need to test the effect, you can execute `touch /lzcsys/var/runtime/config/disable_auto_mount_home` after ssh to enable this security configuration in advance.
