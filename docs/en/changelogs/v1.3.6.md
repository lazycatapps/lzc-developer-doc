v1.3.6 Released on 2025-5-9

# Feature Changes

- Application multi-domain mechanism adjustment [Secondary Domains](../advanced-secondary-domains)
- Added fan control related operations `hc fanctl` in ssh
- Multi-instance applications will be assigned independent domains (browsers and other third-party access no longer need to add `uid@` operations)
- Multi-instance applications support TCP/UDP forwarding
- Truly implemented domain conflict resolution (different applications using the same `application.subdomain`, system will automatically modify the domain of the application installed later)
