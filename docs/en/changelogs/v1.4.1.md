v1.4.1 Released on 2025-11-19

# Feature Changes

- Added `services.[].healthcheck` field, maintaining 100% compatibility with docker-compose.
- Added `timeout` field to `application.health_check`
- `timedatectl set-timezone xx` after ssh supports permanent storage


# Compatibility Changes
- Deprecated `services.[].health_check` field, new code should use `healthcheck` field.
  If existing lpk files have `health_check.start_period` (previously only this time-related configuration was supported), they need to migrate to the `healthcheck` version
  and add unit suffix.
  Previously, no matter what this field was set to, the final health check for services (excluding app) would be forced to `start_period=300s, start_interval=1s`, meaning the developer's set value was silently deprecated. Therefore, no compatibility handling is done to expose the issue as soon as possible.
