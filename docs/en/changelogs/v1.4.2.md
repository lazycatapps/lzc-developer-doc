v1.4.2 Released on 2025-12-10

# Feature Changes

- pkgm now returns more detailed installation error reasons
- Preinstalled systemd-container component
- Support mounting `/lzcsys/run/clientfs`; lpk-level support requires a later lzcos version
- Fix `public_path` issues in multi-instance mode

# Compatibility Changes

Further improve compatibility between `manifest.yml/services` and the docker compose spec.

Main impacts on existing lpk:
1. `services.xx.user` values like 1000 will error; use "1000"
2. `services.xxx.evironment` will error when empty
