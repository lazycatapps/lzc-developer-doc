# Development Mode

LCMD MicroServer has two development modes: application mode (lzcapp) and traditional mode.

- **Application Mode**: Comprehensive design and support for lzcapp development, debugging, distribution, deployment, running, and access. Friendly to end users, but developers need some time to familiarize themselves.
- **Traditional Mode**: Deploy applications using traditional NAS methods based on KVM and independent Dockerd. Very friendly for developers to experiment with themselves, not limited by application mode. However, it cannot be easily distributed to other LCMD users.
