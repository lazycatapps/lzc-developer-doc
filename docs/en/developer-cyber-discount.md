# Developer Hardware Discount

Many LCMD MicroServer developers are authors of open source projects, writing a large number of open source patches contributed to upstream communities, including Linux Kernel, Golang Compiler, Emacs, Qt, ArchLinux and other communities.

Including my personal growth and learning over the past twenty-plus years, all benefited from the open source community. To give back to the open source community, we have decided to provide lifetime hardware purchase discounts for all open source contributors.

As long as you have three open source projects, each with at least 10 commits and 10 stars, please email us at lazycat.manatee@gmail.com

Thank you for your contribution to open source projects!
