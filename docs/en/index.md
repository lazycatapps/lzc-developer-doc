# Welcome to LCMD MicroServer
Welcome to LCMD MicroServer. LCMD MicroServer is a new generation of private cloud products. LCMD MicroServer provides infrastructure including external network penetration access, network security transmission, multi-terminal platform adaptation, cross-platform JS runtime, container management, AI large model services, application building and distribution. Through this tutorial, you can quickly learn the development, building, and installation methods of LCMD MicroServer applications. We look forward to your masterpiece!

## LCMD MicroServer Philosophy

I've been in the open source community for over 20 years and observed a phenomenon: the power and creativity of a super hacker is often stronger than that of a company. When they share their creativity with the world, they rarely receive equal material returns.

The fundamental reason is: "After personal data is public cloud-based, business models ultimately all rely on data monetization logic. When more and more business models are centered on data privacy, applications and cloud services are just tools for traffic entry and data acquisition. This is exactly what capital is good at, and developers who are good at creativity and tools can't survive because they don't have that much money and lose at the starting point of competition."

LCMD MicroServer's goal is to protect personal data in users' own hands through private hardware. When hardware and cloud services are just tools, individual developers have the opportunity to make money through tools. When the competitiveness of cloud services is no longer data, cloud servers, and capital, cloud services will eventually return to creativity, quality, and service. This competitive landscape will trigger healthy market competition. Consumers also benefit from more cloud service developers participating, gaining greater benefits and more choices.

Therefore, we hope that LCMD MicroServer's philosophy includes the following three principles:

1. **User Data Autonomy**: We believe users should have complete control over their digital assets. Through home servers, you can independently manage data, programs, and access permissions. This not only protects privacy but also allows you to freely choose and switch applications without being locked into a single service. We hope to provide users with more choices and stimulate market vitality through this approach.

2. **Lowering Innovation Barriers**: We hope to make it easy for individual developers to start businesses. By distributing computing resources to homes, we reduce startup costs. In this way, developers can focus on creativity and service quality rather than capital competition. We believe this will bring more diverse services, meet users' diverse needs, and also provide more opportunities for experienced developers.

3. **Open Ecosystem**: We are committed to building an open ecosystem. We oppose artificial barriers set up for business considerations that limit interoperability between devices. Instead, we embrace open source technologies and open protocols, encourage developers to make full use of various APIs, and promote compatibility between different brands of hardware. Our goal is to create a seamlessly connected digital hub for users.

These principles reflect our pursuit of user freedom, innovation spirit, and open cooperation. We believe that through this approach, we can create more value for users and developers and promote the healthy development of technology.
