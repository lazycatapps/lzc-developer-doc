# Community Incentive Rules
To make LCMD MicroServer applications more numerous and better to use, we have prepared red envelope rewards for community contributors:

#### 1. Port High-Quality Self-Hosted Applications
For each successfully ported self-hosted application, we will give a 100 yuan red envelope reward.

For porting game masterpieces' server-side, for each successfully ported one, we will give a 300 yuan red envelope reward. The criteria for game masterpieces are: beautiful graphics, relatively famous, and many players. For general quality game server-side, 100 yuan each.

Open source software must include the upstream author's address, and closed source software is also welcome to be listed in the store.

When two developers port the same application, the incentive red envelope will only be given to the first application to be listed, and only applications with normal functionality can be listed.

#### 2. Original Applications
Original applications developed by developers themselves are incentivized at 150 ~ 500 yuan, and the incentive amount is comprehensively evaluated based on the application's functionality, interface beauty, and quality stability. Currently, it's quite subjective, so please understand.

Original applications that respond to user needs and update features will continue to be incentivized.

#### 3. Integrate with LCMD Account System and Cloud Storage Right-Click Menu Interface
On the basis of porting applications, if you can also integrate with the LCMD account system or cloud storage right-click menu interface, we will give an additional 50 yuan red envelope reward.

For self-ported applications with integration features, each application rewards 150 yuan red envelope.
Fork other developers' software and add integration features, each application rewards 50 yuan red envelope.

#### 4. Write Store Application Guides

We provide 50 yuan red envelope rewards for high-quality application guides. To ensure the guide content is practical and valuable, please follow the rules below. Only guides that meet these rules can receive rewards.

**Requirements for High-Quality Guides**
Guides must be authentic, detailed, and provide complete guidance for specific use cases of the application. Specifically including:
1. **Include software screenshots and link to app store**: The guide needs to insert actual software interface screenshots and clearly link or reference relevant information from the app store.
2. **Steps are authentic and effective**: All operation steps must be based on actual testing to ensure users can successfully reproduce them.
3. **Detailed introduction for specific use cases**: Choose a typical scenario of the application (such as daily use or professional functions) and provide complete steps from start to finish.
4. **Key explanations for complex applications**: For applications with more complex operations, provide detailed explanations of key steps, operation techniques, or parameter filling rules (such as input format, precautions).
5. **Use case examples**: Use actual examples to illustrate the application's applicable scenarios and help users understand its value.
6. **Share practical tips**: Focus on content-level tip sharing, for example, in AI image generation applications, not only introduce software operations but also emphasize how to optimize Prompts to achieve better results.

**Guide Types Not Eligible for Rewards**
The following types of guides may pass review and be listed, but do not have sufficient depth or innovation, so they cannot receive red envelope rewards:
1. **Simple tool software**: The software itself is ready to use out of the box, requires no complex operations, and has no shareable content tips (such as basic calculators).
2. **Only labeling and translating interfaces**: Only simple labeling or translation of software interfaces without providing actual usage guidance.
3. **Isolated button introductions**: Only superficial descriptions of a certain button or function without a complete usage flow.

Please note that even if guides are not eligible for rewards, as long as the content is accurate and meets basic standards, they can still be reviewed and listed. We encourage everyone to create high-quality content to receive rewards and help more users!

#### 5. Application Types Not Eligible for Red Envelopes
Of course, some types of applications are temporarily not within the reward scope, such as pure web games, pure book pages, pure tutorial websites, web offline applications, different mods of game servers, or pure database software.
If developers feel these applications are necessary, everyone is welcome to upload them to the app store.

#### 6. Application Types That Cannot Be Listed in the App Store
Currently, pornography, gambling, drugs, airdrops, cracked software, or software that violates Chinese laws cannot be listed in the app store.

::: warning
Additional note: For applications that require usernames and passwords, if regular users cannot obtain corresponding credentials in the Lazycat store, they cannot be listed in the Lazycat store.
